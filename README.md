# nostr-php-relay
PHP Relay written in PHP


  This is a chat server from Flynsarmy modified to act a Nostr relay server

  There are still a lot of things to do, but for now it is enough to connect a chat client based on the Nostr protocol.
  
  The Nostr part of the client is from github.com/supertestnet/vanilla-js-nostr.   
  
  Contact me in Nostr telegram channel if you want to connect to a running instance.
